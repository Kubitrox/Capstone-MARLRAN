1. General submission rules:
- each commit should include a concise title, answers to two questions: “why?” and “what?” and optionally any additional information
- commits shall be done after each finished, verified and working change that could be done independently. However, if some of the conditions cannot be met and it is not possible to continue working on the code at that moment, it is required to commit all changes in a separate branch with all required information according to the guidelines above, together with additional information on when the work is going to be continued or anything else that could be useful to other groupmates
- everyone is responsible for different parts of the code. The responsible person is going to be stated in a precise planning document, as well as at the beginning of each file or part of it
